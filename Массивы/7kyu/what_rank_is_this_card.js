/*
What is the rank of a playing card? The function takes a string like '2c' or 'Kh' and returns a value based on rank of the card. The first character corresponds to the rank of the card and the second character corresponds to the suit of the card. Cards 2-9 should return the corresponding number. T returns 10, J => 11, Q => 12, K => 13 and A => 14. Otherwise the rank should be returned as 0.

For example:

rank('2c') == 2;
rank('Tc') == 10;
rank('As') == 14;
rank('1c') == 0; // There is no card '1'
Suits can be disregarded.
